The **Scenes** tab is the primary workspace for reviewing and refining your generated sequence. It provides a split-panel interface with a scene list, a media player, and detailed editing tabs.

## Layout

The scenes view has three main areas:

- **Scene List** (left sidebar on desktop, bottom drawer on mobile) — Scrollable list of all scene thumbnails with status indicators
- **Scene Player** (center) — Large preview showing the selected scene's image or video, sized to your sequence's aspect ratio
- **Detail Tabs** (below the player) — Six tabs for inspecting and editing each scene

## Scene List

Each scene in the sidebar shows:

- **Thumbnail** — The generated image (or a placeholder if still generating)
- **Status indicators** — Visual badges showing image and motion generation status
- **Scene number** — Sequential position in the sequence

Click any scene to select it. On mobile, scenes appear in a bottom drawer that can be pulled up.

### Batch Motion Generation

At the top of the scene list, a **Generate Motion** button lets you start video generation for all eligible frames at once (frames with completed images but no video). You can optionally include music generation in the batch.

## Scene Player

The central player displays:

- **Still image** — When no video exists yet
- **Video playback** — When motion has been generated, with play/pause controls
- **Progress overlay** — During generation, shows the current phase name
- **Variant preview** — When browsing image variants, shows the alternate image with a "Click Set Image to use" badge

The player automatically sizes to match your sequence's aspect ratio (16:9, 9:16, or 1:1).

## Detail Tabs

Below the player, six tabs provide different views and controls for the selected scene.

### Variants Tab

Generate multiple visual interpretations of a scene. This is useful for A/B testing different compositions or finding the best framing.

- **Generate Scene Variants** — Creates a grid of variant images using the selected image model
- **Click any variant** to set it as the scene's primary image
- **Choose a different model** before generating to compare outputs across providers

### Script Tab

Shows the original script extract for this scene — the exact text from your screenplay that corresponds to this scene. Also displays the scene duration.

### Cast Tab

Shows which characters appear in this scene. Each character links to their detail page where you can view their full profile and recast them.

### Location Tab

Shows the location for this scene with its reference image and details. Links to the location's detail page for updating references.

### Image Tab

Full control over the scene's image generation:

- **Editable prompt** — The full visual prompt used to generate the image. Edit it to refine the composition, lighting, or details.
- **Character count** — Displayed in real-time as you edit
- **Model selector** — Switch between image models for this specific scene
- **Shorten Prompt** — AI-powered prompt compression that preserves intent while reducing length. Shows the reduction percentage (e.g., "Prompt shortened by 35% (2400 to 1560 chars)")
- **Generate Image** / **Regenerate Image** — Create a new image with the current prompt and model
- **Set Image** — When previewing a variant from a different model, set it as the scene's primary image
- **Copy Prompt** — Copy the prompt to clipboard

### Motion Tab

Control over the scene's video generation:

- **Editable prompt** — The motion direction prompt (camera movements, character actions). Edit to change the animation style.
- **Model selector** — Switch between video models for this scene. Models are filtered by aspect ratio compatibility and style category.
- **Optimised prompt preview** — Shows the fully assembled prompt that will be sent to the model, including dialogue and audio cues from the script. Displays character count against the model's maximum prompt length.
- **Generate Motion** / **Regenerate Motion** — Create a new video clip
- **Copy Prompt** — Copy the assembled prompt to clipboard

## Smart Retry

If any images or videos fail to generate, a **failure summary banner** appears at the top of the scenes view with:

- A count of failed items
- **Smart Retry** — Automatically retries only the failed items
- **Regenerate All** — Takes you back to the script tab for a full regeneration

## Real-Time Progress

During generation, progress banners show:

- **Generation Progress** — For the initial pipeline (script analysis, image generation, etc.) with phase indicators
- **Motion Progress** — For batch motion generation, tracking individual frame completion
- **Estimated time** — Based on the number of frames and selected model

Progress updates arrive via Server-Sent Events (SSE) in real-time. If the connection drops, the UI falls back to polling.
