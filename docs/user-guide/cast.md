The **Cast** tab shows all characters identified during script analysis. OpenStory automatically extracts character details from your screenplay and generates visual reference sheets for each one.

## Character Grid

Characters appear as a grid of cards, each showing:

- **Character sheet image** — A generated reference image showing the character
- **Name** — The character's name as identified in the script
- **Role information** — Basic details extracted from the script

Click any character card to view their full detail page.

## Character Detail Page

The detail page provides comprehensive information about a character:

### Character Sheet Image

A 16:9 reference image generated from the script's character description. This image is used as a visual anchor for consistency across all scenes featuring this character.

During regeneration, a loading spinner replaces the image with "Regenerating character sheet..." text.

### Character Properties

All properties are automatically extracted from your script:

| **Consistency Tag**         | Internal tag used to maintain visual consistency across scenes (shown as a monospace code badge) |

### Casting Status

Each character shows one of two states:

- **Auto-generated from script** — The character's appearance was generated purely from script descriptions
- **Cast as [Talent Name]** — The character has been recast using a talent from your library

## Recasting a Character

You can replace a character's auto-generated appearance with a talent from your library:

1. Click **Recast** on the character detail page
2. A **Talent Picker** dialog opens showing all talent in your library
3. Select a talent
4. A **confirmation dialog** appears showing:
   - The character name and talent name
   - How many frames will be affected
5. Confirm to recast

Recasting regenerates the character's reference sheet using the talent's reference images and updates all frames where the character appears.

## Adding to Talent Library

If a character doesn't have an associated talent yet, you can click **Add to Library** to save them to your team's Talent Library for reuse in future sequences.

## Real-Time Updates

Character sheet regeneration happens asynchronously. The UI subscribes to real-time events (`generation.character-sheet:progress`) and automatically updates when:

- Generation starts (shows loading state)
- Generation completes (refreshes the character data)
- Generation fails (restores previous state)
