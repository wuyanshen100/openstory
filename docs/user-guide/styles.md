Styles define the overall visual aesthetic of your sequence — color palette, artistic direction, lighting, and rendering approach. Every sequence requires a style.

## Selecting a Style

When creating or editing a sequence, the style selector appears below the script editor as a row of tiles.

### Quick Selection

The most popular styles are shown directly as square tiles with:

- **Preview image** — A sample image showing the style's look
- **Name overlay** — The style name at the bottom of the tile
- **Selection highlight** — A primary-color border and subtle scale-up when selected

### Full Catalog

Click the **More** tile (shown with a `...` icon) to open the full style selection dialog. This shows all available styles with larger previews, names, and categories. Click any style to select it and close the dialog.

## How Styles Work

Each style includes a configuration object that influences the AI generation:

- **Color Palette** — Defines the dominant colors. When no preview image is available, a gradient is generated from the palette.
- **Artistic Direction** — Guides the overall visual treatment (photorealistic, cinematic, illustrated, anime, etc.)
- **Rendering Approach** — Affects how prompts are constructed for image generation

## Style Categories

Some motion models require specific style categories. For example, the **Seedance 2** motion model is restricted to **animation** styles. If you select a style from a different category, incompatible motion models are automatically switched to the default.

## Style and Script Enhancement

When you use **Enhance Script**, the selected style's configuration is passed to the AI. The enhanced screenplay is tailored to match the style's visual language — for example, a noir style produces darker, moodier descriptions while a vibrant pop-art style produces bold, colorful ones.
