The **Music** tab lets you generate AI music and sound effects that match your sequence's mood and merge them with your video.

## Music Generation

OpenStory automatically generates a music prompt and tags from your script during analysis. The Music tab shows:

### Prompt Ready State

When the music prompt is ready but not yet generated:

- **Editable prompt** — The AI-generated music prompt describing the desired soundtrack. You can edit this before generating.
- **Tags** — AI-generated genre/mood tags (e.g., "cinematic, ambient, dramatic")
- **Model selector** — Choose which music generation model to use
- **Duration** — Defaults to the total video duration. Shows a warning if the video duration exceeds the model's maximum.
- **Generate Music** button

### Generating State

A spinner with "Generating music..." text. Music generation happens asynchronously.

### Completed State

Once music is generated:

- **Audio player** — HTML5 audio controls for previewing the track
- **Model selector** — Switch models for regeneration
- **Read-only prompt and tags** — Shows what was used to generate
- **Regenerate Music** — Generate a new track with different settings
- **Merge with Video** — Combine the audio track with your video clips into a final video

### Failed State

If generation fails, the error message is displayed with a **Retry** button.

> Video is 95s but lyria_2 max is 30s — music will be clamped.

## Merging Video and Music

After generating music, click **Merge with Video** to combine:

1. All motion clips are concatenated in scene order
2. The music track is mixed in
3. A final `.mp4` file is produced

The merge status shows as "Merging..." with a spinner. When complete, the merged video appears in the **Theatre** tab.
