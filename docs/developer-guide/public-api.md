description: Create AI video sequences programmatically — one-shot create, poll for status, with HAL links, ?wait long-polling, and an OpenAPI 3.1 spec
section: Developer Guide
order: 1

OpenStory exposes a small public HTTP API so agents and scripts can create video
sequences without driving the UI. It is **self-describing**: an agent can learn
the whole surface from two unauthenticated endpoints and never has to read this
page.

## Discovery

- `GET /api/v1` — the API root: an instructions narrative, the create request
  JSON Schema, and a HAL `_links` catalog of available actions.
- `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` — the full OpenAPI 3.1 specification, generated from
  the same schema the API validates against.

Both are unauthenticated so tooling can discover the API before a key is wired
up. `https://openstory.so/llms.txt` also points here.

## Authentication

Every endpoint except discovery requires an API key. Create one in the dashboard
under **Settings → Developer**. Send it as either header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <key>
x-api-key: <key>
```

Keys are team-scoped — a key only ever sees its own team's sequences — and rate
limited to **10 requests/second**; exceeding it returns `429` with a `Retry-After`
header.

## Create a sequence

`POST /api/v1/sequences` turns a script into a video sequence. Generation is
asynchronous: the call returns `202` immediately with the created sequence id(s)
and a status URL to poll.

```bash
curl -X POST https://openstory.so/api/v1/sequences \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENSTORY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "script": "A lighthouse keeper befriends a stranded whale.",
    "title": "Sea Tale",
    "style": "Cinematic Noir",
    "targetSeconds": 30,
    "motion": true,
    "music": true,
    "characters": ["Old Tom the keeper", { "name": "The whale", "isHuman": false }],
    "locations": ["Stormy lighthouse"]
  }'
```

The body is ergonomic: reference a style, cast member, or location by id or name,
or pass an inline object to create a new one. `enhance` (`auto` | `always` |
`off`) controls script expansion; `motion` and `music` toggle video and score.
See `GET /api/v1` or the OpenAPI spec for the full request schema.

Response (`202`):

```json
{
  "sequences": [
    {
      "id": "seq_…",
      "status": "draft",
      "workflowRunId": "…",
      "statusUrl": "/api/v1/sequences/seq_…",
      "_links": {
        "self": { "href": "…", "method": "GET" },
        "poll": { "href": "…", "method": "GET", "templated": true }
      }
    }
  ],
  "enhancedScript": "…",
  "_links": { "self": { "…": "…" } }
}
```

## Poll for status

`GET /api/v1/sequences/{id}` returns a database-derived status document: overall
status, the `style` and `models` it was generated with, aspect ratio, per-frame
image/video status and URLs, music, poster, and ready/failed counts. Because it
is derived from the database it is always correct, even if you reconnect later.

`style` is `{ id, name }` (the name is `null` only in the rare case the style
row fails to resolve) and `models` is `{ analysis, image, video, music }` — the
raw model ids. These are the same values the dashboard filters and searches
sequences on.

A terminal `completed` status can still carry `counts.videosFailed > 0` — a
failed frame does not fail the whole run — so check the counts to confirm an
end-to-end success.

## List your sequences

`GET /api/v1/sequences` returns your team's sequences, most recent first. Each
entry is a compact summary of the status document — `status`, `aspectRatio`,
`style`, `models`, `poster`, `music`, and the ready/failed `counts`, but **not**
the per-frame array — with a `self` link to its full status document.

```bash
curl "https://openstory.so/api/v1/sequences?limit=20" \
  -H "x-api-key: $OPENSTORY_API_KEY"
```

Page with `?limit` (default 20, max 100) and the opaque `?cursor` returned in the
response's `_links.next`. Follow that link to fetch the next page; its absence
means you've reached the end. Archived sequences are excluded.

## Long-polling with `?wait`

Agents often have no sleep tool, so every pollable endpoint accepts
`?wait=<duration>` (`60s`, `30`, `2m`, `1500ms`; capped at 90s). The server holds
the request open and returns the moment the sequence changes or reaches a
terminal state:

```bash
curl "https://openstory.so/api/v1/sequences/seq_…?wait=60s" \
  -H "x-api-key: $OPENSTORY_API_KEY"
```

The response carries `X-Wait-Changed` (did it advance?) and `X-Wait-Done` (is it
terminal?) headers. On `POST`, `?wait` additionally embeds each new sequence's
first progress snapshot, with `waitChanged`/`waitDone` flags per sequence. A
malformed `wait` value is rejected with `400` rather than silently downgrading to
a non-blocking request.

## Conventions

- **HAL links.** Every response includes a `_links` map of the actions available
  from that resource, each stating its `method`. Follow links rather than
  hardcoding paths.
- **Errors are always JSON:** `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details"? } }`
  with the matching HTTP status — never an HTML page or redirect.
