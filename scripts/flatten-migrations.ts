/**
 * Render drizzle-kit's nested migrations into the flat layout wrangler needs.
 *
 * drizzle-kit emits `drizzle/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`,
 * but `wrangler d1 migrations apply` only reads flat `*.sql` files in
 * `migrations_dir` — against the nested layout it silently finds zero files
 * (see scripts/migrate-local-d1.ts). This script writes each migration to
 * `drizzle/migrations-wrangler/<timestamp>_<name>.sql` (gitignored, rebuilt
 * from scratch on every run), so the nested directory stays the single
 * source of truth.
 *
 * Ordering: wrangler sorts unapplied migrations by NUMERIC filename prefix
 * (parseInt of the segment before the first underscore), and records applied
 * ones by full filename in `d1_migrations`. drizzle's fixed-width 14-digit
 * timestamps make numeric and lexicographic order coincide — keep that
 * prefix shape for any hand-named migration (a non-numeric prefix sorts as
 * NaN). src/lib/db/migrations-layout.test.ts pins this.
 *
 * Run by the `deploy` and `db:migrate:prd` package scripts, and directly by
 * the PR-preview migrate step in .github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml.
