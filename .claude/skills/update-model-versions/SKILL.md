description: >
  Check whether newer versions of the AI models we already use (fal.ai image,
  video/motion, audio; OpenRouter text) or our @tanstack/ai* packages have
  shipped, and open a PR bumping any genuine successor. Use when asked to
  "check for model updates", "are our models current", "bump models", or when
  run by the daily model-freshness routine. Only bumps EXISTING models to a
  newer version of the same model — it does not add net-new models.

# Update model versions

Our model registries are the single source of truth:

| Class                   | File                          | Export                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Text (OpenRouter)       | `src/lib/ai/models.config.ts` | `SCRIPT_ANALYSIS_MODELS` |
| Image (fal.ai)          | `src/lib/ai/models.ts`        | `IMAGE_MODELS`           |
| Video / motion (fal.ai) | `src/lib/ai/models.ts`        | `IMAGE_TO_VIDEO_MODELS`  |
| Audio (fal.ai)          | `src/lib/ai/models.ts`        | `AUDIO_MODELS`           |
| AI SDK packages         | `package.json`                | `@tanstack/ai*`          |

The goal each run: detect newer versions → verify each is a real successor →
open a focused PR that bumps it → leave everything green.

## 1. Detect candidates

```bash
bun models:check          # human-readable report
bun models:check --json   # { ok, errorCount, hasUpdates, models[], packages[] }
```

`scripts/check-model-updates.ts` reads the registries and queries public,
unauthenticated catalogs (fal.ai `/api/models`, OpenRouter `/api/v1/models`, npm
registry). It is HTTP-only so it runs anywhere — no `FAL_KEY` or MCP needed.
Behind a proxy it routes through `curl` (Bun's fetch can't traverse a
TLS-intercepting proxy), so `curl` must be on PATH in that case.

Candidates are **heuristic** (same brand, higher version number, same modality,
not already adopted). Treat them as leads to verify, not facts.

**Check `ok` before trusting the result.** `ok: false` (equivalently, a non-zero
exit code or `errorCount > 0`) means one or more lookups FAILED — the report is
INCOMPLETE, not "all current". Do not treat a failed run as "nothing to do":
fix connectivity and re-run. Only when `ok` is `true` does `hasUpdates: false`
genuinely mean every model is current — in that case, stop.

## 2. Verify each candidate is a genuine successor

Do not bump on the heuristic alone. For each flagged candidate decide: _is this
the same model, one version newer — or a different product line / tier?_

**fal models — prefer the fal tooling (richest signal):**

- **genmedia CLI** (what the fal community skills use; works headless):
  ```bash
  curl https://genmedia.sh/install -fsS | bash   # once, if missing
  genmedia setup --non-interactive --api-key "$FAL_KEY"
  genmedia models --endpoint_id <candidate-id> --json   # confirm it exists
  genmedia schema  <candidate-id> --json                # compare input params
  genmedia pricing <candidate-id> --json                # cost delta
  ```
- **fal-ai MCP** if available in this session: `search_models`,
  `get_model_schema`, `get_pricing` give the same data.
- **Fallback (zero-auth):** the OpenAPI spec — a 200 means the endpoint is real:
  `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://fal.ai/api/openapi/queue/openapi.json?endpoint_id=<id>"`,
  and `https://fal.ai/models/<path>/llms.txt` for param specs (see CLAUDE.md).

**text models:** confirm the candidate id resolves on
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` and keeps the same tier (don't turn a
`-mini` into a non-mini, or a `pro` into `flash`).

**Reject a candidate when** it is a different tier/variant (fast/lite/standard
vs pro, lora/trainer/edit gear), a different modality, a preview/experimental
build replacing a stable one, or its schema/pricing changed so much it needs
product judgement. When unsure, skip it and note it in the PR body rather than
guessing.

## 3. Apply the bump (one PR per upgrade)

Work one upgrade at a time so each PR is reviewable and revertible.

**Idempotency — check first:** `gh pr list --state open --search "in:title model"`.
If an open PR or branch already covers this exact bump, skip it. Branch name:
`auto/model-update-<registry-key>-<new-version>` (e.g.
`auto/model-update-minimax_hailuo_02-2.3`).

**Golden rule: change the `id` (and metadata), never the registry KEY.** Keys
are persisted in the DB (a team's selected model) and referenced across selectors
and schemas — renaming one is a breaking migration, out of scope here.

Per class, edit and follow through:

- **Text** (`models.config.ts`): update `id`, `name`, `description`,
  `contextWindow`. If you bump `DEFAULT_ANALYSIS_MODEL`'s model, the constant
  references a key, so it's unaffected.
- **Image** (`models.ts` `IMAGE_MODELS`): update `id`, `name`, `description`,
  `maxPromptLength`. If the model has an `EDIT_ENDPOINTS` entry, update that
  endpoint id too. Confirm the new endpoint still supports the edit/reference
  flow if it had one.
- **Video / motion** (`models.ts` `IMAGE_TO_VIDEO_MODELS`): update `id` + meta,
  then regenerate the schemas — **`bun motion:codegen`** (writes
  `src/lib/motion/generated/**` and `endpoint-map.ts`). Never hand-write motion
  schemas. Re-check `maxPromptLength` against the new schema.
- **Audio** (`models.ts` `AUDIO_MODELS`): update `id` + `capabilities`
  (durations, formats) from the new schema.
- **fal pricing:** model ids are pricing keys in `src/lib/ai/fal-pricing-data.ts`
  (auto-generated). After any fal id change run **`bun scripts/update-fal-pricing.ts`**
  (needs `FAL_KEY`). If it can't run, add the new id's pricing manually via the
  override path documented in that script and flag it in the PR.
- **Packages:** bump the `@tanstack/ai*` range in `package.json`, then
  `bun install`. Skip major bumps (breaking) — open an issue for those instead.

## 4. Quality gates (must pass before opening the PR)

```bash
bun typecheck
bun lint
bun run test src/lib/ai src/lib/motion   # registry + motion suites
bun run test src/lib/billing             # pricing/cost if fal pricing changed
```

Fix anything that breaks. If a bump cascades into non-trivial changes (schema
shape changed, pricing model differs, tests need rework), stop and open an
**issue** describing it instead of forcing a half-working PR.

## 5. Open the PR

```bash
git checkout -b auto/model-update-<key>-<version>
git commit -am "chore(models): bump <name> <old> → <new>"
gh pr create --title "chore(models): bump <name> <old> → <new>" --body "<body>"
```

PR body must include, per change: registry key, old id → new id, why it's a
genuine successor, links (fal model page / OpenRouter / npm), pricing delta, and
which generated files / pricing were regenerated. End with: "🤖 Opened by the
daily model-freshness routine (#792). Verify pricing & quality before merge."

Leave PRs as **draft** only if a quality gate is amber (e.g. pricing couldn't be
auto-fetched); otherwise ready-for-review. Do not merge — a human reviews.
