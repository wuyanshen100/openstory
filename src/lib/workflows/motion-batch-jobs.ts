/**
 * N+M fan-out expansion for `MotionBatchWorkflow` (#545).
 *
 * Multi-model video generation runs one motion child per `(shot, model)` —
 * the motion analog of shot-images' per-`(scene, model)` fan-out. Pulled out
 * of the workflow body (mirroring `motion-workflow-persist`) so the expansion's
 * invariants are unit-testable without bootstrapping a `WorkflowEntrypoint`.
 *
 * Resolution rules (kept deliberately distinct from `resolveVideoModels`, which
 * has different defaulting):
 *   - top-level `videoModels` (deduped) applies to every shot when present;
 *   - otherwise each shot falls back to its own `model` (single-model paths);
 *   - a shot with neither falls back to `DEFAULT_VIDEO_MODEL`.
 *
 * Models are deduped per the top-level list so a model is never generated (or
 * billed) twice for the same shot, which also keeps the `(shotIndex, model)`
 * pair — and therefore each child's CF instance id — unique.
