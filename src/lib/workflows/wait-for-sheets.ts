/**
 * Durable "wait for sheet generation" helpers for the matching workflows.
 *
 * When a user adds new talent or a new location while creating a sequence
 * (`TalentSuggestionSelector` → `createTalentFn`,
 * `LocationSuggestionSelector` → `createLibraryLocationFn`), the sheet /
 * reference-image generation runs in a *separate*, fire-and-forget workflow
 * (`/library-talent-sheet`, `/library-location-sheet`). The sequence's
 * `analyze-script-workflow` then spawns `talent-matching` / `location-matching`
 * which read those sheets:
 *
 *   - talent matching uses `talent.defaultSheet?.imageUrl` as the casting
 *     reference image, and
 *   - location matching SKIPS any library location without a
 *     `referenceImageUrl`.
 *
 * If the sheet workflow hasn't finished by the time matching reads the row, the
 * pre-cast talent gets an empty reference image (so the character no longer
 * looks like the chosen person) and the pre-selected location is dropped from
 * matching entirely. This helper closes that race by polling the DB in a
 * durable loop until every still-pending entity has its sheet — bounded by a
 * timeout so a sheet that failed to generate can't stall the whole pipeline.
 *
 * The poll uses `step.do` (durable, replay-safe) for each read and `step.sleep`
 * between reads, mirroring the batched-polling pattern in `motion-workflow.ts`.
