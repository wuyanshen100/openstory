/**
 * Detect provider content-filter / model-rejection errors so the image and

 * failing on the first hit (#881).
 *
 * fal surfaces these as HTTP 422s whose `body.detail` carries the human
 * message (extracted by {@link extractFalErrorMessage}). Observed in the
 * 2026-06-10 sample run:
 *
 *   - flux:     "The content could not be processed because it contained
 *                material flagged by a content checker."
 *   - kling:    "… material flagged by a content checker."
 *   - veo:      "The model did not generate the expected output for this
 *                prompt … unsafe content"
 *   - veo:      "Could not generate images with the given prompts and images.
 *                Please try again with different inputs."
 *   - seedance: "Output audio has sensitive content."
 *
 * Many of these (especially the veo "did not generate / could not generate"
 * strings) are stochastic and clear on a reseeded re-roll; a subset are
 * deterministic content-checker hits that will exhaust the retry budget and
 * fail as before (acceptable — a later prompt-sanitize pass targets those).
