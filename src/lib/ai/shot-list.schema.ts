/**
 * Shot-list analysis schema (#908)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Stage 2 of the Scene / Shot / Frame milestone. Scene analysis stops emitting
 * shot-sized "scenes" and instead emits **scenes containing 1..N shots**, each
 * with a STRUCTURED shot prompt. The split is decided here — during analysis,
 * where the script, dialogue and pacing context live — not downstream in the
 * motion-prompt step.
 *
 * ## Why a separate schema (union budget isolation)
 *
 * Anthropic's strict structured-output grammar caps a request at 16
 * union-typed parameters, and `convertSchemaToJsonSchema` compiles every
 * `.optional()` / `.catch()` / `.nullish()` field into a `["T","null"]` union
 * (an `anyOf` in the emitted JSON Schema). The existing
 * `sceneSplittingResultSchema` already carries optionals; nesting a rich
 * shots[] array inside it would blow that budget. This schema is authored
 * SEPARATELY and kept STRICTLY union-free — every field is required and
 * emptyable by convention ('' / [] / sensible scalar), with no Zod `.default()`,
 * so the model emits the empty value explicitly rather than the parser filling
 * it. The union-budget block in `shot-list.schema.test.ts` asserts the compiled
 * grammar stays at zero `anyOf` so the budget can never be silently exceeded.
 *
 * ## Single source of truth (derive, don't double-author)
 *
 * Scene-level shared truth (location, lighting, cast, palette, style) is stated
 * ONCE per scene by the LLM and reused across every shot. The start-frame
 * visual prompt and the motion prompt are ASSEMBLED from scene context + the
 * shot's own structured fields (see `shot-list.derive.ts`) — never re-derived
 * per shot by the model. This is the structural fix for adjacent-clip drift.
 *
 * ## Model-agnostic
 *
 * The analysis annotates a shot list with framing, one action, exactly one
 * camera move (paired with a pacing adverb), a sound cue and a duration. It
 * never emits vendor-specific syntax (Seedance/Kling/etc.) — the render layer
 * (#910) adapts per model capability.
