/**
 * Render segments (#990) — tiling a scene into ≤cap render units.
 *
 * The render unit is NOT the scene: a render model caps a single render at a
 * per-model duration (15s for current models, 30s for newer ones), so a scene's
 * video is an ordered tiling of **segments**, each a contiguous shot-subset
 * whose total duration is ≤ the model cap. The common case (scene ≤ cap) is one
 * segment = the whole scene; long scenes split; per-shot rendering is the
 * degenerate case (one shot per segment).
 *
 * A segment is a persisted `render_segments` row; its `id` (with the model) is
 * the key under which `video_variants` versions for that segment accumulate. Its
 * membership is the ordered shotIds it covers (`shots.renderSegmentId`).
 *
 * The cap is sourced per-model from the model's JSON Schema duration set (the
 * same source `snapDuration` snaps to), never a hardcoded constant.
 *
 * See docs/architecture/scene-shot-frame-redesign.md.
