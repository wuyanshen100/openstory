/**
 * Resolve a stale workflow run via its Cloudflare Workflow instance status.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - 'failed'    when the runId is empty, or doesn't resolve to a known
 *                 workflow binding (e.g. a legacy QStash run id from before the
 *                 cutover — the row is already stale, so fail it for retry),
 *                 or the instance reports `errored` / `terminated`.
 *   - 'completed' when the instance reports `complete`.
 *   - null        when the instance is genuinely still in flight
 *                 (queued/running/paused/waiting).
 *   - 'unknown'   when the status lookup itself threw (transient API blip or
 *                 evicted instance) — we can't say whether a run is live.
 *                 Errors are logged, not propagated.
 *
 * Both `null` and `'unknown'` mean "don't write a terminal status", but
 * callers that surface state to users (the generation mutex) must not claim
 * a run is in progress on `'unknown'` — there may be no run at all.
 * Reconciler passes treat both as "skip and retry next sweep."
