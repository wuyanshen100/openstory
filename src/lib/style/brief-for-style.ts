 * lives here, free of any DB-schema imports, so client code (the logged-out
 * sample-video showcase + gallery, which prefill the composer from a brief) can

/**
 * One-liner brief per style `category`, fed through the script-enhancer so each
 * style gets a script that suits it. Every category present in
 * `style-templates.ts` has an explicit entry (enforced by a unit test) — no
 * silent default that would render an off-brief sample.
 *
 * Every brief names a concrete subject AND an event — the first render round
 * proved that a subject-less brief ("a new product launch") enhances into the
 * same inert anticipation→reveal→logo mood piece for every style, and a
 * 15-second sample where nothing happens is a boring sample. Scenes become
 * motion clips, so the brief must describe visible motion.
 *
 * Every human subject is given an explicit gender and a short visual
 * descriptor. Neutral nouns ("a courier", "a dancer") made the enhancer
 * default to singular "they", which the image model rendered as androgynous
 * figures AND gave the character-bible nothing to lock identity onto across
 * cuts — the exact consistency #801 is about. The descriptor doubles as the
 * bible's anchor, so name what the person looks like, not just what they do.
 *
 * @public Exported for the invariant checks in `sample-videos.test.ts`, which
 * knip ignores; `briefForStyle` is its only in-app consumer.

 * 1. Creative-direction overrides that intentionally reshape the generated

 *    hands), `animated` (a physical poster, not a hologram), `beach-ritual`

 *    `restaurant-menu-hero`) — the entry here is only the review-tool BRIEF
 *    label, kept matching so it doesn't show the generated multi-cut text.

  // Creative-direction override: perfume advertising trades on allure, so the

  // the canonical render toward the sultry, sensual register the genre expects.
  'perfume-editorial':
    'A sultry high-fashion perfume film in warm, low-key light. A strikingly beautiful woman in a liquid-gold silk slip reclines against deep velvet, bare shoulders and collarbone glowing; she draws a faceted amber bottle slowly along the line of her neck, lips parted, eyes half-closed, as backlit mist drifts past — then turns a slow, smouldering look straight to camera while a sheer curtain billows behind her.',
  // Creative-direction override: the generated briefs for these two were
  // faceless "hands only" product shots — boring, and they never exercise the
  // character-consistency pipeline. Put a real on-camera woman (face visible,
  // recurring across all three scenes) front and centre.
  'product-ad':
    'A woman with sleek dark hair and a cream linen shirt unscrews a frosted-glass serum bottle on a sunlit bathroom shelf, dispenses a glossy drop onto her fingertip, and presses it across her cheek as warm late-afternoon light catches the dewy texture.',
  'ugc-unboxing':
    'A bubbly young woman with a messy bun and chipped pink nails films herself on her phone, grinning to camera as she tears open a cardboard box, peels back tissue paper, and lifts out a sleek skincare bottle to show it off.',
  // The generated brief asked for a "holographic wanted-poster", which fights
  // the visual-prompt generator's hard NO-HOLOGRAPHIC-SCREENS rule and rendered
  // as a blank blue rift. Use a physical paper poster instead.
  animated:
    'A grizzled male bounty hunter in a tattered crimson coat strides through a rain-slicked neon alley, then halts before a weathered paper wanted-poster nailed to a wall, recognition crossing his scarred face as its torn edges lift in the wind.',
  // New style (no generated brief yet): pin the generate-style-briefs.ts output
  // here so it renders on-brief instead of falling back to the off-style
  // commercial category brief. Regenerate the full set to retire this.
  'beach-ritual':
    'A tanned woman with sun-bleached wavy hair in a coral swimsuit wades out of the turquoise surf at golden hour, pushing her wet hair back and laughing as she lifts a frosty bottle from the wet sand, the handheld camera tracking her toward weathered timber with lens flares dancing.',
  // Single-shot review labels — the verbatim render lives in
  // CANONICAL_SCRIPT_OVERRIDES; kept matching so the review BRIEF isn't the
  // generated multi-cut text.
  'mood-only-frames':
    'a single continuous mood frame in one charcoal-and-amber palette — incense smoke curls up through a hard diagonal shaft of light as it slowly intensifies, one unbroken locked shot, no scene change',
  '360-turntable':
    'a single continuous 360 turntable pass — one pair of premium wireless earbuds in an open charging case makes one unbroken slow revolution on a seamless white pedestal, the same case throughout, no cuts',
  'restaurant-menu-hero':
    'a single continuous signature-dish hero — one unbroken overhead shot as a ladle pours glossy amber jus across a plated sliced duck breast and a hand lowers a final micro-herb garnish, the same dish throughout, no cuts',
