/**
 * Build an image-generation prompt that art-directs a SCENE in a style.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices fix the "too literal" failure mode (issue #718):
 *  1. We never inject the style *name*. For medium-named styles ("Pop-Up Book",
 *     "Animatic", "As Seen On Phone") the name makes the model render the
 *     artifact (a book, a storyboard sheet) instead of a scene in that look.
 *  2. We frame the scene as the subject and the style fields as *treatment*,
 *     and forbid grids / panels / collage so e.g. an animatic renders one frame,
 *     not a sheet of numbered panels.
 *
 * The aesthetic comes entirely from `config` (artStyle/mood/lighting/cameraWork/
 * colorGrading/referenceFilms). Shared by the preview thumbnails
 * (`generate-style-previews.ts`) and the sample-video stills
 * (`generate-style-sample-videos.ts`) so the framing lives in one place.
