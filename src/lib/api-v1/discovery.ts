/**
 * The `GET /api/v1` root document — the API's self-description, modelled on the
 * `instructions` an MCP server returns at initialize time. An agent that reads
 * this once should know what the API is for, how to authenticate, the
 * create→poll workflow, the cross-cutting conventions (`?wait=` long-poll, HAL
 * affordances, the forward-looking `stepUp`/`idempotencyRequired` hints), and
 * have a copy-pasteable example body — without reading external docs.
 *
 * The root is intentionally unauthenticated: discovery should work *before* a
 * caller has wired up a key, so the narrative can tell them how to get one.

const INSTRUCTIONS = `OpenStory public API v1 — create AI video sequences from a script in one call.

Workflow:
  1. POST /api/v1/sequences with a script (and optional style, cast, locations,
     elements, model choices). Generation is asynchronous: you get back 202 with
     the created sequence id(s), workflow run id(s), and a statusUrl to poll.
  2. GET the statusUrl to watch progress: overall status, the style and models
     used, per-shot image/video status + URLs, music, poster, and ready counts.
     Status is derived from the database, so it is always correct even if you
     reconnect later.

List your sequences:
  GET /api/v1/sequences returns your team's sequences, most recent first. Each
  entry is a compact summary (status, aspect ratio, style, models, poster,
  music, and ready/failed counts) with a 'self' link to its full status
  document. Page with ?limit (default 20, max 100) and the opaque ?cursor from
  the response's 'next' link.

Enhance only (no sequence):
  POST /api/v1/scripts/enhance to expand/polish a script without generating a
  video. Takes the enhancement-relevant inputs (style, aspectRatio, targetSeconds,
  elements) and STREAMS the result back as Server-Sent Events: unnamed 'data:'
  shots each carry { "delta": "..." }; a final 'event: done' shot carries the
  full { "enhancedScript": "..." } plus a '_links' catalog whose
  'create-sequence' affordance embeds a ready-to-POST example body using the
  enhanced script (with enhance: "off"). Errors after streaming starts arrive
  as an 'event: error' shot.

Authentication:
  Every endpoint except this root requires an API key. Create one in the
  dashboard under Settings → Developer. Send it as either
  'Authorization: Bearer <key>' or 'x-api-key: <key>'. Keys are team-scoped and
  rate limited to 10 requests/second.

Conventions (apply to every endpoint):
  - ?wait=<duration> long-polls: instead of busy-polling, append e.g. ?wait=60s
    (also 30, 2m, 1500ms; capped at 90s) and the server holds the request open,
    returning the moment the resource changes or reaches a terminal state. Ideal
    when you have no sleep tool of your own. On POST, ?wait also embeds the first
    progress snapshot of each new sequence in the response.
  - HAL: every response carries a '_links' map of the actions available from
    that resource. Each link states its 'method', and write links state their
    'contentType' and 'examples'. Follow links rather than hardcoding paths.
  - Links may also declare 'stepUp' (needs step-up auth) or 'idempotencyRequired'
    (needs an Idempotency-Key header) so you know a requirement before you call,
    not via a 4xx. No v1 endpoint sets these today; they are forward-looking.

Errors are always JSON: { "error": { "code", "message", "details"? } } with the
matching HTTP status — never an HTML page or redirect.

Machine-readable spec: GET /api/v1/openapi.json returns the full OpenAPI 3.1
document (generated from the same schema this API validates against).`;
