/**
 * HAL (Hypertext Application Language) primitives for the public `/api/v1`.
 *
 * Plain REST makes an agent read prose docs to learn what it can do next and how
 * to call it. HAL flips that: every response carries `_links` — a machine-readable
 * catalog of the affordances available from *this* resource. We extend the bare
 * HAL link (which only standardises `href`/`templated`/`title`) with the fields an
 * LLM actually needs to call an endpoint without guessing:
 *
 *   - `method`       — the HTTP verb (HAL assumes GET; writes need this stated).
 *   - `contentType`  — request body media type for write affordances.
 *   - `examples`     — concrete example request bodies / values, inline.
 *   - `stepUp` /
 *     `idempotencyRequired` — declared *requirements*, so an agent learns a call
 *     needs step-up auth or an `Idempotency-Key` header up front, instead of
 *     discovering it via a 4xx. (Not enforced today — forward-compatible hints.)
 *
 * `href` values are server-relative (`/api/v1/...`); callers resolve them against
 * the origin they reached us on. Templated hrefs use RFC 6570 (`{id}`, `{?wait}`).
