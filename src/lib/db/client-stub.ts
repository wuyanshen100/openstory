/**
 * Drizzle Database Client — Storybook stub.
 *
 * Activated by the `storybook` import condition in package.json's `imports.#db-client`.
 * Storybook never reaches `getDb()` at runtime — `.storybook/server-stub-plugin.ts`
 * replaces every server-only path (`@/functions/*`, `@/lib/auth/server`, etc.) with a
 * chainable Proxy before code that touches the DB ever runs. This file exists so the
 * import resolves to something with zero `@libsql/client` / `drizzle-orm` cost in the
 * Storybook bundle.
