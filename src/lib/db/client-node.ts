/**
 * Drizzle Database Client — Node / unit-test context.
 *
 * Activated by the `default` import condition in package.json's `imports.#db-client`
 * (i.e. anything that isn't Workerd or Storybook: plain Node, Vitest).
 *
 * The app only touches the database inside Workerd, where `#db-client` resolves
 * to `client-d1.ts` (Cloudflare D1). This module exists so that:
 *   - `Database` (`ReturnType<typeof getDb>`) is typed against the libSQL driver
 *     that unit tests inject via `drizzle({ client, relations })` from an
 *     in-memory `@libsql/client` database.
 *   - any Node code that reaches `getDb()` without injecting its own instance
 *     fails loudly instead of silently connecting somewhere unexpected.
