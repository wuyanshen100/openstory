```

`bun dev` runs vite dev (cf-plugin → Workerd via Miniflare, port 3000). Its first step (`scripts/ensure-env.ts`) creates `.env.local` with generated secrets if missing, so a fresh clone needs only `bun install && bun dev`. Billing work uses `bun dev:all`, which additionally runs the Stripe listener (skipped without `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`); it lives outside `bun dev` so a missing/uninstalled Stripe CLI never takes down the app server (e.g. in cloud preview sandboxes). The app runs in **Workerd locally** — same runtime as production — so D1, R2 bindings, **Cloudflare Workflows**, env.\* access, and request lifecycle all match prod. No QStash/Docker needed: workflows execute in-process in Workerd.

**Local Cloudflare services via the Explorer API.** While `bun dev` is running you have access to local Cloudflare services (KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects, and Workflows) for this app via the Explorer API at `http://localhost:3000/cdn-cgi/explorer/api`. Fetch that URL to get the OpenAPI schema and discover available operations, then use those endpoints to list, query, and manage local resources during development. `bun explorer` opens the Explorer UI in a browser.

**Bun-as-launcher pattern:** `bun script.ts` (no `--bun`) keeps Bun as the CLI launcher but executes under **Node**, while still autoloading `.env*`. Use `bun --env-file=<path>` to override the default `.env.local`. No `--bun` flag should appear in package.json scripts.

## Project Structure

  routes/           # TanStack Router file-based routes
    api/            #   Webhooks (workflows + auth only)
    _app/           #   App shell (anonymous-browsable; actions gated behind login)

```

## Architecture

**Stack:** Bun (package manager + script launcher; Node is the runtime) · TanStack Start + Router + Vite (`@cloudflare/vite-plugin`) · Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle · Cloudflare Workflows (durable async) · Cloudflare R2 · Better Auth · Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui · Vitest.

**Core rules:**

- Database access ONLY in server handlers (never in components).
- Anonymous-first → upgrade to save work.
- Team-based resources (sequences, styles, characters).
- Script-driven generation for consistency.

**Data model:**

```
teams
  ├── users (members)
  ├── sequences (videos)
  │   └── frames (scenes with metadata)
  └── libraries (styles, characters, vfx, audio)
```

## Setup

```bash
bun install
bun dev                            # That's it — env, migrations, seed all happen on first run
bun setup                          # Optional: add FAL_KEY / OPENROUTER_KEY interactively
bun setup --prod                   # Production config + deploy (--deploy, --pr-preview also available)
```

**Branch + commit conventions:** Branches must be named `<issue-number>-feature-name` (e.g. `393-improve-readme`). Lefthook extracts the issue number and tags commits with `#<issue>` automatically. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Lefthook also runs quality checks pre-commit.

## Server Handler Pattern

All API routes use TanStack Start server handlers. Standard shape:

```typescript
// src/routes/api/example/$id.ts
export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/example/$id')({
  server: {
    middleware: [authWithTeamRequestMiddleware],
    handlers: {
      POST: async ({ params, request, context }) => {
        try {
          const input = schema.parse(await request.json());
          const { user, teamId } = context;

          const record = await db.insert(table).values({ ...input, teamId });

          // Trigger a durable workflow (see Workflow Pattern below)
          const workflowRunId = await triggerWorkflow('/image', {
            userId: user.id,
            teamId,
            ...input,
          });

          return json({ id: record.id, workflowRunId });
        } catch (error) {
          const handled = handleApiError(error);
          return json(
            { success: false, error: handled.toJSON() },
            { status: handled.statusCode }
          );
        }
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Steps: 1) validate input · 2) auth via `authWithTeamRequestMiddleware` (user/teamId on `context`) · 3) DB writes (only here) · 4) trigger workflow · 5) standardized response.

## Workflow Pattern

Durable async work runs on **Cloudflare Workflows**. Each workflow is a
`WorkflowEntrypoint` subclass; there is no QStash and no HTTP callback route.

**Triggering workflows — use `triggerWorkflow(path, body)`** from
`@/lib/workflow/client`. It resolves the workflow binding for `path` (see
`TRIGGER_TO_BINDING` in `src/lib/workflow/trigger-bindings.ts`) and calls
`binding.create()`, returning the workflow instance id (store it as
`workflowRunId`):

```typescript
const workflowRunId = await triggerWorkflow('/image', {
  userId,
  teamId,
  prompt,
  ...params,
});
```

Pass a stable `deduplicationId` in the options to make a trigger idempotent.

**Defining workflows** — each lives in `src/lib/workflows/<name>-workflow.ts`,
extends `OpenStoryWorkflowEntrypoint` (`src/lib/workflow/base-workflow.ts`),
and must be wired in three places (a test in
`src/lib/workflow/wiring-consistency.test.ts` enforces this):

1. `wrangler.jsonc` `workflows[]` — declares the binding + `class_name`.
2. `src/server.ts` — re-exports the class so it lands in the Worker bundle.
3. `TRIGGER_TO_BINDING` in `src/lib/workflow/trigger-bindings.ts` — maps the
   trigger path to the binding name.

The base class validates `userId`/`teamId` on the payload, builds a
`ScopedDb`, and sanitizes/handles failures. Subclasses implement
`runImpl(event, step, scopedDb)`, run steps via
`step.do('step-name', async () => { ... })` (durable, auto-retried), and write
DB updates directly. For parent→child fan-out (await a child's result), use
`spawnAndAwaitChild` from `src/lib/workflow/await-child.ts`.

## Frame System

Frames are the core content unit — each represents one scene from script analysis.

**Critical:** `frame.metadata` IS the `Scene` object (no wrapper). Fully typed via Drizzle JSONB.

```typescript
frame.metadata = {
  sceneId,
  sceneNumber,
  originalScript: { extract, lineNumber, dialogue },
  metadata: { title, durationSeconds, location, timeOfDay, storyBeat },
  variants: { cameraAngles, movementStyles, moodTreatments }, // A/B/C options
  selectedVariant: { cameraAngle, movementStyle, moodTreatment, rationale },
  prompts: {
    visual: { fullPrompt, negativePrompt, components, parameters },
    motion: { fullPrompt, components, parameters },
  },
  continuity: { characterTags, environmentTag, colorPalette, lightingSetup },
  musicDesign: { presence, style, mood, atmosphere },
};
```

Access via `frameService.getSceneData(frame)`, `getVisualPrompt(frame)`, `getMotionPrompt(frame)`, or directly: `frame.metadata.metadata.title`, `frame.metadata.prompts.visual.fullPrompt`. Storing the full scene lets us regenerate without re-analyzing the script and preserves variants for retries.

## Fal.ai Integration

**Always check `/llms.txt` before updating models.** Machine-readable, authoritative param specs:

```
https://fal.ai/models/{model-path}/llms.txt
# e.g. https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/image-to-video/llms.txt
```

More reliable than HTML docs; essential for `src/lib/ai/models.ts`. **For new motion models, run `bun motion:codegen`** to auto-generate schemas — don't write inline.

Motion status checking: `checkMotionStatus(statusUrl)`, `getMotionResult(responseUrl)`, `cancelMotionGeneration(cancelUrl)` from `@/lib/services/motion.service`, or `bun scripts/check-motion-status.ts <url>`.

## Server-side export (API)

Exporting a sequence to one stitched MP4 exists in **two** places:

- **Browser** (`src/lib/sequence-player/export.ts`, `use-sequence-export`) — the Theatre "Export MP4" button. Uses WebCodecs + Web Audio in the user's browser. **Unchanged.**
- **Server** (#968) — the public API. WebCodecs/Web Audio don't exist on Workers, so the heavy lift runs in a **Cloudflare Container** (`containers/video-export/`, Node + `@mediabunny/server`/NodeAV). Flow:
  - `POST /api/v1/sequences/$id/exports` reserves a `sequence_exports` row (`status: processing`) and triggers `SequenceExportWorkflow`; `GET …/exports` lists/polls them. (`src/routes/api/v1/sequences.$id.exports.ts`)
  - `SequenceExportWorkflow` (`src/lib/workflows/`) does **all** DB access via `scopedDb`, absolutizes scene/music URLs (`toShareableUrl`), POSTs the job to the container, streams the returned MP4 into R2 (`uploadFile`), and flips the row to `ready`/`failed`. The container is a **stateless renderer — it never touches D1**; it only gets URLs + params over HTTP.
  - `sequence_exports` gained `status`/`error`/`workflowRunId` (additive). `listBySequence`/`getLatest` are `ready`-only (the browser UI never sees in-flight/failed server rows); the API uses `listAllBySequence`.
- **v1 scope:** transmux-compatible (uniform AVC) sequences + music/dialogue mix. Mixed-resolution re-encode is rejected server-side (browser still handles it) — a follow-up.
- **Local dev:** `bun dev:all` runs the export service (`dev:bunny`, host bun runtime — no Docker, `node-av`/FFmpeg works under bun) AND sets `VIDEO_EXPORT_DEV_URL=http://localhost:8080` (via `CLOUDFLARE_INCLUDE_PROCESS_ENV`, the same injection Playwright uses) so the workflow POSTs to it instead of the (production-only) container binding — a full local export loop, zero config. Plain `bun dev` doesn't set the var (prod uses the container); for a two-terminal `bun dev` + `bun dev:bunny` setup, set `VIDEO_EXPORT_DEV_URL` in `.env.local` yourself. The container uses **bun** as its package manager (`bun.lock`, `trustedDependencies: ["node-av"]`) but **Node** as the image runtime. Container details, contract, and Docker build/smoke-test: `containers/video-export/README.md`.

---

## Database

**Schema management:**

```bash
bun db:generate  # Generate migrations from schema changes
bun db:migrate   # Apply migrations to local.db
```

- Schema in `src/lib/db/schema/` (Drizzle auto-infers types).
- **NEVER** hand-write migration SQL.
- **ULID** primary keys (not UUID).
- **Typed JSONB:** `frame.metadata` typed as `Scene`.

### wrangler.jsonc env layout — READ BEFORE TOUCHING

**Why the env split exists.** Remote bindings are **opt-in per binding** in current wrangler/`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` (`"remote": true`); local dev simulates everything in Miniflare by default. But the split is not just a remote-bindings guard — each block has its own job (see below), and historically the plugin DID default remote bindings on, which leaked Better Auth verification rows into `openstory-prd` D1 mid-#755. The placeholder-id strategy keeps that incident class impossible even if a plugin default flips again or someone runs a `--remote` command against the dev config.

**The structure.** `wrangler.jsonc` separates dev from prod via env blocks:

- **default** (no env) — triple duty: (1) `bun dev` / `vite dev` / `bun cf:dev` local simulation, (2) the patch base for PR-preview deploys (CI rewrites D1/bucket/workflow names in place), and (3) the provisioning template for Deploy-to-Cloudflare button deploys — its `database_name`/`bucket_name` are what a button user's fresh resources get called, and `tail_consumers` must stay `[]` so button deploys don't reference our log-forwarder Worker. The D1 binding has a **placeholder** `database_id: "dev-local-d1"` so any misrouted remote call (or buggy preview patch, or wrong-env deploy) 404s against Cloudflare rather than silently writing to prod. R2 buckets are **local Miniflare** too — stored media URLs are origin-relative (`/r2/<key>`, #894) and the worker's `/r2/$` route streams them from the binding when `R2_PUBLIC_STORAGE_DOMAIN` is unset (with a CDN domain set, the route redirects to it). Local dev needs no Cloudflare credentials. (Opt back into remote R2 by setting `"remote": true` on the binding + `R2_PUBLIC_STORAGE_DOMAIN` in `.env.local`; revert when done.)
- **`[env.production]`** — real prod D1 (`database_name: openstory-prd`, `database_id: d5981bee-...`; the `#897` cutover recreated it from the old `velro-prd`/`d6a35f64-...`, which is retired). Production builds MUST set `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production` (so the built `dist/server/wrangler.json` bakes this block) and the migrate step MUST pass `--env=production` (wired in `deploy:production` / `cf:deploy:prd`). This block ALSO declares the **video-export Cloudflare Container** (#968): `containers[]` (built from `containers/video-export/Dockerfile`), the `VIDEO_EXPORT_CONTAINER` Durable Object binding, and migration tag `v2`. It is **production-only** so `bun dev` and e2e stay Docker-free — `wrangler deploy`/Workers Builds builds + pushes the image (Docker required only at deploy, which Workers Builds provides). See "Server-side export" below.
- **`[env.test]`** — Playwright e2e. Local Miniflare D1 (`database_id: "openstory-test-local"`) AND local Miniflare R2 — fully hermetic, no Cloudflare credentials in CI. Activated via `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=test` (set in `playwright.config.ts` envPrefix and CI workflow env block) for `vite dev`, or `wrangler dev --env=test` for the built-server path.

**Rules:**

- Never add `"remote": true` to a D1 binding. The placeholder-id strategy is the safety net.
- Production deploys run on **Workers Builds** (dashboard-connected to `main`, #900): build command `bun run build` with `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production` as a build env var, deploy command `bun run deploy:production`. Manual fallback: `bun cf:deploy:prd`. Don't deploy a build made without `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production` — it bakes the default block (placeholder D1) and fails loudly.
- PR-preview deploys patch the default block at runtime in `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` and deploy without `--env`. Each PR gets its own real D1 named `openstory-pr-<n>`.

**Local guardrail:** `bun dev` prints a wrangler-bindings banner on startup showing each binding's `local` / `REMOTE` status. If `DB` ever shows REMOTE, kill the server immediately and fix the config before any write lands in prod.

**Reproducing a prod bug locally:** temporarily set the default D1's `database_id` to the real prod value, restart `bun dev`, and revert when done. **Never commit a real prod D1 id into the default block.**

### D1 table-rebuild trap — READ BEFORE CHANGING SCHEMA

Remote migrations apply via `wrangler d1 migrations apply` (#897/#900: the `deploy` script for button deploys, `deploy:production` for upstream prod on Workers Builds, `db:migrate:prd` inside `cf:deploy:prd` for manual deploys), which sends each migration file as one multi-statement body. D1 wraps multi-statement bodies in an implicit transaction, and SQLite **silently** ignores `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` inside a transaction. So when the standard SQLite "table rebuild" pattern (`CREATE __new_X` → `INSERT SELECT` → `DROP X` → `RENAME`) drops the parent table, every inbound `ON DELETE CASCADE` FK fires and child rows are deleted. (The original #612 incident hit the same trap through drizzle-kit's `d1-http` migrator, which no longer touches remote DBs — drizzle-kit only generates migrations now. Note drizzle-kit emits nested `<dir>/migration.sql` files; `scripts/flatten-migrations.ts` renders the flat gitignored `drizzle/migrations-wrangler/` dir that wrangler reads.)

This destroyed `team_members`, `session`, `account`, and `passkey` in production on 2026-04-29 (issue #612, migration `20260428013041_productive_kabuki`). `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys = ON` does **not** help — it defers constraint _checks_ but CASCADE still fires.

**Workarounds (in order):**

1. **Avoid table rebuilds.** Prefer `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN / ADD COLUMN / DROP COLUMN` — SQLite/D1 support these without a rebuild.
2. **Apply destructive migrations manually.** Snapshot first (`wrangler d1 export`), then apply via the D1 dashboard or `wrangler d1 ... --file=…`. Do not let the automated `wrangler d1 migrations apply` paths run it (mark it applied in `d1_migrations` afterwards so they skip it).
3. **Avoid `ON DELETE CASCADE`** on FKs to long-lived parent tables (`user`, `teams`, `sequences`). Use `'restrict'` or `'no action'` and clean up children in app code.

**Local guardrail:** `scripts/check-migrations.ts` runs as a Lefthook pre-commit step on staged `drizzle/migrations/**/*.sql`. It flags `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE FROM`, `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN`, and annotates each `DROP TABLE` with the count of inbound `ON DELETE CASCADE` FKs. Bypass for a manually-applied migration: `bun scripts/check-migrations.ts --allow-destructive`.

**Schema-drift trap (#898):** drizzle-kit only diffs **top-level exported** tables — removing a table's named export from `src/lib/db/schema/index.ts` (e.g. in a dead-code sweep) makes the next `db:generate` emit `DROP TABLE` for it. Keep every table individually exported. And never change a column's SQL `.default()` without generating the migration in the same PR — a default change forces a full table rebuild (see trap above); prefer `$defaultFn()` for app-level defaults with no DDL impact.

## React Patterns

**Quick reference** (rules; examples below for the contrarian ones):

- **Server data:** TanStack Query with `suspense: true`. No `isLoading` checks; use `<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />} />`.
- **Styling:** shadcn/ui base components handle theming; Tailwind ONLY for layout (`flex`, `grid`, `gap`). No hard-coded colors. No `margin` on components — use flex+gap on the parent.
- **Loading:** inline `<Skeleton />` fallbacks that mirror final content (no separate skeleton components).
- **Visibility:** CSS `hidden`/`block` (pre-render) rather than conditional mounting, to avoid layout shift.
- **Forms:** TanStack Query mutations + Zod (`safeParse`) — no controlled-input boilerplate, use `FormData`.
- **Routing:** TanStack Router `createFileRoute`, params via `Route.useParams()`. URL reflects state via search params.
- **Files:** `kebab-case.tsx`, named exports, vanilla TS (`.ts`) for logic. `@/` alias. No default exports.

### Data fetching

```tsx
// ❌ useState + useEffect
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
useEffect(() => { fetch(...).then(r => r.json()).then(d => { setUser(d); setIsLoading(false); }); }, [userId]);
if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

// ✅ TanStack Query + Suspense — no isLoading checks
const UserContent: React.FC<{ userId: string }> = ({ userId }) => {
  const { data: user } = useQuery({ queryKey: ['user', userId], queryFn: () => fetchUser(userId), suspense: true });
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
};

export const UserProfile: React.FC<{ userId: string }> = (props) => (
  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton className="h-6 w-32" />}><UserContent {...props} /></Suspense>
);
```

### Styling

```tsx
// ❌ Hard-coded colors, dark variants, margin on the component
<div className="w-[300px] m-4 p-6 bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 text-slate-900 dark:text-white rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">{frame.title}</h3>
</div>

// ✅ shadcn base handles theming; Tailwind for layout only; gap on parent (not margin on child)
<Card onClick={onSelect} className="cursor-pointer">
  <CardHeader><CardTitle>{frame.title}</CardTitle><CardDescription>{frame.description}</CardDescription></CardHeader>
</Card>

// Parent owns spacing:
<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  {frames.map(f => <FrameCard key={f.id} frame={f} />)}
</div>
```

### Forms

```tsx
// ❌ Controlled inputs everywhere, manual validation, setState per field

// ✅ Uncontrolled + FormData + Zod + TanStack Query mutation
export const ScriptForm: React.FC = () => {
  const mutation = useMutation({ mutationFn: createScript });

  const onSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const result = scriptSchema.safeParse(
      Object.fromEntries(new FormData(e.currentTarget))
    );
    if (!result.success) return; // surface errors inline
    mutation.mutate(result.data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <Input name="title" placeholder="Script title…" required />
      <Button type="submit" disabled={mutation.isPending}>
        {mutation.isPending ? 'Creating…' : 'Create'}
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

See `src/components/` for the house pattern.

## UI/UX Non-Negotiables

- Keyboard: full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/); visible `:focus-visible` rings.
- Inputs: hit targets ≥24px (mobile ≥44px), `font-size` ≥16px, never block paste, `autocomplete` + correct `type`/`inputmode`. Enter submits inputs; Ctrl/Cmd+Enter submits textareas.
- State: URL reflects filters/tabs/pagination; back/forward restores scroll. Use TanStack Router `<Link>` (supports Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click).
- Feedback: optimistic UI with rollback or Undo; confirm destructive actions; `aria-live="polite"` for toasts; ellipsis (`…`) for loading states.
- Animation: honor `prefers-reduced-motion`; animate `transform`/`opacity`; interruptible. CSS > WAAPI > JS libs.
- Accessibility: redundant cues (not color-only), `aria-label` for icon-only buttons, tabular numerics for comparisons, prefer native semantics.
- Performance: virtualize long lists (`virtua`); explicit image dimensions; mutations <500ms.

---

## Testing

**Unit-test framework:** Vitest (run via `bun run test`, never `bun test` — that invokes Bun's built-in runner and ignores `vitest.config.ts`).

- Server handlers: `__tests__/` alongside routes.
- Services/utils: co-located (`service.test.ts`).
- Focus: business logic, not React components.
- DB: mock `#db-client` via `vi.doMock` (not real connections); ULID primary keys.
- Workflows: mock workflow context + AI calls; pass auth (userId/teamId) through context.
- `vitest.config.ts` is **self-contained** — it does not extend `vite.config.ts`, because the Cloudflare Vite plugin rejects the SSR-externals shape Vitest injects.

**Module-mocking pattern** (preserves the runtime-ordered semantics bun:test's `mock.module` had — `vi.doMock` is NOT hoisted, so dynamic-import the target after mocking):

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import * as realModule from '@/lib/some-module';

const mockFn = vi.fn();
vi.doMock('@/lib/some-module', () => ({ ...realModule, someExport: mockFn }));

// Dynamic import so the mock applies. Static imports are hoisted above
// vi.doMock and would bypass it. Prefer vi.mock + vi.hoisted for top-of-file
// mocks if you need static imports; vi.doMock + await import is the most
// direct port of the bun:test pattern.
const { thingUnderTest } = await import('./thing-under-test');
```

When re-mocking inside an `it()` block to test a different code path, call `vi.resetModules()` first — otherwise the dynamic import returns the cached module from the prior mock.

**E2E:** Playwright drives `vite dev` (cf-plugin → Workerd) on port 3001 with `E2E_TEST=true`. `bun test:e2e:setup` applies D1 migrations against the isolated `[env.test]` block in `wrangler.jsonc` and seeds via `getPlatformProxy()`. Aimock (`:4010`) intercepts LLM/fal calls. R2 is NOT mocked: uploads do real puts into the local Miniflare R2 binding (asset bytes come from the real `fal.media` URLs recorded in aimock fixtures) and reads are served by the worker's `/r2/$` route. Recording (`E2E_RECORD=1`) hits real LLM/fal; locally-served URLs sent to real providers are made fetchable via `fal.storage.upload` / data-URIs (`src/lib/storage/external-url.ts`).

## Platform & Deployment

Production target: **Cloudflare Workers** (the only supported platform). Deployment-context helpers (preview/local detection) live in `src/lib/utils/environment.ts`. Workers Builds auto-deploys main (same mechanism as Deploy-button clones); PRs get GitHub Actions preview deployments with unique D1 databases. See `.env.example` for required vars (or `bun setup` for local defaults).
